# Knucklebones

This is a personal project of mine, i recently started playing Cult of the Lamb and thought it would be a cool idea to make an online version of the minigame within COTL called Knucklebones.
</br>
It's a game where you throw die and place them in a grid of 3x3, whoever has more points by the time either of the grids is full, wins.
There's certain elements of the game that make it good for dueling like eliminating the enemy die when you match them in your own grid and multiplicating the points you have if you match die that you already have in a column.
<br>
Overall it's a cool little game that i enjoyed and it'll be a challenge to create a real time multiplayer experience but i'm sure i'll learn a lot from doing this project!.
